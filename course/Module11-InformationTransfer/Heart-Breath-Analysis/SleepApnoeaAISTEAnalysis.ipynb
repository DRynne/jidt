We already computed these for the breath rate using AIS, and in code we could read these out as above and include them here; but let's calculate again to confirm we get the same result.

    "Now that we have determined two significant relationships from heart rate and blood oxygen concentration to breath rate, and all of their embedding parameters, let's examine conditional transfer entropies from each of them to the breath rate.\n",
    "1. Open a new instance of the AutoAnalyser and select the Conditional Transfer Entropy.\n",
    "2. Select the `Kraskov (KSG)` estimator, and the `SFI-heartRate_breathVol_bloodOx-extract.txt` data set as before.\n",
    "3. Leave the source column at 0 (heart rate), destination column at 1 (breath rate) and conditional column at 2 (blood oxygen concentration).\n",
    "4. Check the `Add stat. signif.?` button, as we wish to check the statistical significance of our measurements.\n",
    "5. Set `DYN_CORR_EXCL` to 21 as above.\n",
    "6. Set the embedding variables for the breath rate (`k_HISTORY` and `k_TAU`) and heart rate (`l_HISTORY` and `l_TAU`) to any non-default values that were determined for their pairwise TE above.\n",
    "7. Set the `DELAY` to the optimised value determined for the pairwise TE between heart rate and breath rate above.\n",
    "8. Now set the embedding values for the blood oxygen concentration as the conditional:\n",
    "    * Set `COND_EMBED_LENGTHS` to the value determined for `l_HISTORY` in the blood oxygen to breath rate analysis.\n",
    "    * Set `COND_TAUS` to the value determined for `l_TAU` in the blood oxygen to breath rate analysis.\n",
    "    * Set `COND_DELAYS` to the value determined for `delay` in the blood oxygen to breath rate analysis.\n",
    "9. Now press `Generate code and Compute` and inspect the result. Is there a significant conditional TE here? What can you determine from that:\n",
    "    * Would the heart rate be usefully added to a model of the dynamics of breath rate, if blood oxygenation was already included in the model? Is this what you expected from above? (In other words, does the heart rate add information that blood oxygen concentration does not alone -- and could we see clues about this from our investigations above?)\n",
    "    * Does it mean there is or is not a directed relationship from the heart rate to breath rate alone?\n",
    "    * What does it mean for how we would consider both sources? If you had to choose one source only in a model of the breath rate, which would it be and why? Would you use both sources? (Can you conclude fully on this without running another calculation?)\n",
    "    * If the result was not (or had not been) significant, do you think the result might change if we had more data?\n",
    "10. (_Optional challenge_) Can you investigate the local values of TE from heart rate to breath rate, conditioned on blood oxygenation, to see which effects persisted and which did not? You would take the code generated from the previous step, paste this into the code cell below, then copy and paste the code from the pairwise TE investigation earlier which generated the local TE values and then made the plots with them. You would want to compare the plots made here for conditional TE to those for pairwise TE before. You would find the `plt.clim(-0.5,0.5);` command useful as above."
