So, when you call the function, make sure that you have accepted all output variables as follows: `(result, symbols, probabilities) = simpleinfotheory.entropyempirical(processedStr)`. You can then send the probabilities as an argument to your `simpleinfotheory.infocontent()` code. On comparing to Mackay's results for each character, remember that your Shannon information contents are for the characters in a sorted order, but that order may be different to what the book displays -- yours will be displayed for each character in the order they appear in `symbols` (which is as returned by `np.unique(processedStr)` above)."

    "A more serious challenge would be to display the joint Shannon information contents, and the conditional Shannon information contents, as per Figures 2.2 and 2.3 of Mackay. This cannot be done with a simple modification to our simple Matlab scripts, as they were not set up to return the probabilities in a nicely ordered way for all possible combinations. (That was sacrificed to make your other tasks easier!). But you could attempt to pull out a list of all observed joint symbols and their probabilities, and sort them nicely yourself ready for display in such a figure. We will work further on this in the next module (and solutions are deferred to that module)."
